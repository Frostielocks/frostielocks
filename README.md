## 🏛️ Splynter
_Cyber Security Consultancy and Training_

I work as a security & privacy consultant at various clients and have been lucky to see Splynter grow from year one to where it is now.
My field of expertise encompasses _**ESA, Risk Management, Threat Modeling, SDLC, IoT Security, Cryptography, and Privacy**_.
Sometimes I also give one of our training sessions as a guest teacher.

## 🫎 Caring Caribou 🚗
_A friendly car security exploration tool for the CAN bus_

[Caring Caribou](https://github.com/CaringCaribou/caringcaribou) is a wonderful tool that's kind of like the swiss army knife of automotive security.
I contributed the fuzzer module that lets you send and analyze fuzzing payloads on the CAN bus.
The original prototype of the module is available on my profile at [CAN-Fuzzer](https://github.com/Frostielocks/CAN-Fuzzer).

## 🚀 Hub Industries
_A little self-hosted island in the digital ocean 🌊_

### 🐯 z00
**z00** is a custom self-hosted architecture for deploying and maintaining various tech services. It has its own web architecture, IaC configuration, and ArchiMate model. It's built using a whole lot of FOSS and runs on a DIY network made of old discarded devices!

### 💡 Malibu-Point
[Malibu-Point](https://github.com/Hub-Industries/Malibu-Point-HA) is a publicly available custom Home Assistant configuration that I've maintained for a few years now. It's seen many iterations and has grown with me as I've moved around from place to place.
